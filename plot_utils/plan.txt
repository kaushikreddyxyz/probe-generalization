1. For risky/safe behavior, conditional backdoor, locations, and functions: comparison of test accuracy for
- full finetuning if time permits
- all layer lora
- one layer lora (the best performing layer for each task)
- steering by the first lora pca (same layer as above)
- one layer trained steering vector

2. For risky/safe behavior, locations, and functions, one-layer LoRA and one-layer trained SV sweep with error bars (i can run the risky/safe ones too, looks like it’ll be fast)

3. Cosine similarity and norms of MLP output differences for single layer LoRA. Do this for a bunch of settings but only need to put one in the main paper

4. PCA amount of variance explained by first second third pc. Also do this for a bunch of settings but only need to put one in the main paper

5. Logit lens for learned / natural steering vectors. Probably only works for risky/safe

6. Multiple LoRAs amount to steering on multiple layers. This is not confirmed yet and I’m trying this rn

7. Cosine sim between naive and learned steering vectors for the functions task. 

8. Train and test accuracy for interpolating between them / across different SVs.

9. Whatever plots you have for backdoors
